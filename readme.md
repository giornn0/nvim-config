On a fresh start clone NvChad 

```
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 
```
Then this repo in a custom folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:giornn0/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom 
```
Run nvim

```
nvim 
```

On the first start you can uncoment the nvimtree config so you get the auto installation. After that is necesarily to do some tweaks because it stops working correctly fo elixir
